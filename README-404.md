# 404 Error Handling System for KE-Site-PHP

This document explains how the 404 error handling system works in this application to ensure that users are properly redirected to a custom 404 page when they try to access non-existent resort pages or invalid URLs.

## Overview

There are two redundant systems in place to handle 404 errors:

1. **Apache .htaccess Configuration**: Primary method used by the web server
2. **PHP-based Fallback**: Secondary method used when .htaccess might not be available or supported

## Apache .htaccess Configuration

The `.htaccess` file contains rules that tell Apache to:

- Check if a requested PHP file exists on the server
- If it doesn't exist, redirect to the 404.php page
- Set proper HTTP status codes for search engines

Relevant portions of the .htaccess file:

```apache
# Custom error pages
ErrorDocument 404 /404.php
ErrorDocument 500 /500.php

# Check if the resort page exists, if not redirect to 404
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.php$
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /404.php [L]
```

## PHP-based Fallback System

The `page_not_found_handler.php` file is included at the top of commonly accessed pages (like index.php) and provides a fallback method:

1. It checks if the requested URL is a potential resort page (.php file)
2. It excludes common system pages (index.php, login.php, etc.)
3. It checks the database to see if the resort exists and is active
4. If the resort doesn't exist or is inactive, it redirects to the 404.php page

## Implementation

To implement this system on additional pages:

1. Add this line at the top of any PHP file that might need 404 handling:

```php
<?php
// Include 404 handler to catch invalid pages
include_once('page_not_found_handler.php');
```

## Testing

You can test the 404 handling by:

1. Trying to access a non-existent resort URL: `http://yourdomain.com/resort-that-doesnt-exist.php`
2. Trying to access a deactivated resort (one where is_active = 0 in the database)

Both should redirect to the custom 404 page.

## Notes

- The custom 404 page (404.php) has been designed to match the site's look and feel
- The database check also ensures that inactive resorts (is_active = 0) show the 404 page
- Error logging is in place to track any issues with file/directory access

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the 404 handling:

1. Check if Apache is correctly processing the .htaccess file
2. Ensure the page_not_found_handler.php file is included in key entry points
3. Verify database connections are working correctly
4. Check PHP error logs for any issues

7. **test_activity_direct.php**
   - Created testing tool to verify activity logging functionality
   - Added tests for all new activity types
   - Shows test results and recent activities in a clean interface
   - Helpful for debugging logging issues

## Key Features Added:

- **Automatic Table Creation**: Activity log table is auto-created if it doesn't exist
- **Error Handling**: Logging function gracefully handles errors without disrupting main operations
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations are properly logged:
  - Resort operations (create, update, delete)
  - Resort status changes (active/inactive)
  - Resort partner status changes
  - Destination operations (create, update, delete)
- **Consolidated Dashboard View**: Dashboard shows most recent activities across multiple types
- **Filtering and Pagination**: Activity log viewer provides powerful filtering options
- **Testing Tools**: Dedicated tools for verifying and debugging activity logging
- **User Tracking**: Activities are linked to user accounts for accountability
- **Consistent Formatting**: Uniform look and feel across all activity displays

## How to Use:

1. **Adding Activity Logs**: Use the `log_resort_activity($pdo, $action, $details, $user_id)` function in any file:
   ```php
   log_resort_activity($pdo, 'action_name', 'Action details', $_SESSION['user_id']);
   ```

2. **Viewing Activities**: Go to Dashboard to see recent activities or access the dedicated activity log page at `check_activity_log.php`

3. **Testing**: Use `test_activity_direct.php` to verify logging functionality

## Next Steps:

- Consider adding activity logs for more operations (enquiries, user management)
- Add export functionality for activity logs (CSV/PDF)
- Implement automatic log rotation/archiving for better performance
- Add more detailed filtering options
